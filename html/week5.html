        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week5 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">For week 5, we have 2 full day to develop FRATS, for the first day 
            <br>i continue the work from last week, after studying flask I am able to convert image to BLOB
            <br>(Binary Large Object) and able to insert it to sqlite3 database when user upload the image 
            <br>
            <img src="../img/wk5-1.png">
            <img src="../img/wk5-2.png">
            <br>
            <br>So now when user upload the image the image will store in BLOB and the date time will be recorded.
            <br>After that I have develop the signup and login system so now when user signup a new accont, the 
            <br>new account will be insert to database and user can use the account to login to FRATS
            <br>
            <img src="../img/wk5-3.png">
            <img src="../img/wk5-4.png">
            <br>
            <br>During this process I also face a lot of problem for example at first i dont know we are using flask
            <br>and the front-end developer Jai also dont know so during the merge of front-end and back-end i takes
            <br>me a long time change some html/css to flask.
            <br>But for now there is still a lot of things that is not complete, for example now we have two 
            <br>database for user info and we need to combine them. Now I still new put in notifiaction system
            <br>for to tell user that they have successfully uploaded their image etc. Forgot password still havent
            <br>start yet, back-end for attendance cannot start since Peter and Reginald still working on the opencv
            <br>part. So there is still a lot of things need to do, for next few week we will keep working on it.
