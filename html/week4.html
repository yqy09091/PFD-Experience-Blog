        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week4 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">For week 4, I am still trying to upload the image to the sqlite 
            <br>database so that OpenCV can use them. Last week I make sure that we user able to take a photo
            <br>and download them. This week I add a upload button and a text area to key the user name so that
            <br>
            <img src="../img/wk4-1.png">
            <br>
            <br>I can pass the data to database. Now when the user upload the photo the photo can be seen at
            <br>local folder testiamge. At the same time the data(name only) will be insert to the sqlite database.
            <br>
            <img src="../img/wk4-2.png">
            <br>
            <br>But the problem for now is that since I am new to flask, sqlite3 so I am not sure how to insert 
            <br>a img or a file to the database as now I only manage to find out how to insert text to the 
            <br>database. So this feature have not complete even though we can manually insert the testimg folder
            <br>files to the databse but that was not what we want. 
            <br>So Ill try my best to solve this issue by next week so that we can move on to OpenCV the most import
            <br>part of our porject.
