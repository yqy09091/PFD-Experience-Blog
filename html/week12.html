        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week12 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">During the hoildays till week 12 I have continue for the edit that I want to do.
            <br>First of all I have change some html to correct the FRATS website, now only the login user
            <br>can use the website feature. Secondly when user upload their img they do not need to key in
            <br>their name. For now when user login their name will be save in session and when they upload 
            <br>their name and img will upload to the database at the same time.
            <br>
            <img src="../img/week10-1.png">
            <br>I also edit the database and put 2 table in FRATS.db instead of put each table in seperate
            <br>db, as this ensures that we can easier reference the data between 2 tables. I have make 
            <br>small changes for both table. 1 table for user info and another table for img.
            <br>Lastly, during the previous verison the img only save in local folder or save in database 
            <br>in binary. but now I have edit the code so that It can upload and save in local folder and 
            <br>database at the same time. helpful this can make the OpenCV part easier.
