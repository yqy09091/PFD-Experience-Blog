        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week14 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">During week 14 I have try to improve the code by adding 1 more database table 
            <br>which to store OpenCV face encoding value inside the new database table. For the face encoding data
            <br>It store as a array with long list of numbers inside so I use txt for my database table to store this
            <br>array. But I have face a lot of problem for path and need more time to debug as they are a lot 
            <br>bug and errors occur when I edit the code.
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>The good thing about this code is it can let opencv compared the the database encoding so it can
            <br>mkae our work much easier and faster during comparing.
            <br>So now I need to spend more time to debug the code as get the encoding path really give me a lot of
            <br>problem.
