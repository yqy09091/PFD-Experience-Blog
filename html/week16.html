        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week16 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">For week 16 the last week of pfd, we need to finish the project and the OpenCV
            <br>code is finally working so now it is able to compared 2 imgs and give a result of is this 2 img showing
            <br>the same people. And What I need to do is to pull the img data from database and replace the 1 of the img
            <br>so that the opencv img can compared with the database img. And after a long time of hard work I managed to
            <br>make the thing work.

            <br>
            <br>Next is if the opencv shows that it is the same person I need to insert the data to the new database table that
            <br>contains attendance information. The data contains things like name, time, date, department, attendance.....
            <br>
            <img src="../img/wk16-2.png">
            <br>
            <br>After all data is writing to the database now I need to display the attendance data in the html page, which 
            <br>was not easy especailly need to do this in limited time, after learning more about rows, array and some flask 
            <br>related knowledge I managed to display the attendance data in the html page
            <br>
            <img src="../img/wk16-3.png">
            <br>
            <br>Other than these things, I also managed to fix some bugs here and there like the login function I put a extra
            <br>code in the html page cause some bug and luckily managed to fond out and fix it. In overall this pfd Experience
            <br>is qutie special as I managed to try and learn many new things, work some something new and challenging but things
            <br>is a interesting experience.
