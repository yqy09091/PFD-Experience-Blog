        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week3 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">For week 3, we have not made any changes to our idea.
            <br>So I will continue with the development of the FRATS website. Last week,I have implemented
            <br>the camera for FRATS. This week, I realized that even though we are only using a webcam now,
            <br>we might need to use other cameras in the future. I have edited the code for the website so
            <br>that users can choose the camera they want to use.

            And at the same time, I made some changes to the take photo button. Now when a user uses that button,
            <br>the photo will be taken and simultaneously, the website will download the image, enabling the user
            <br>to upload the image to the database.

            <br>
            Now I am still trying to find a good way to upload the image to database as I am not so familiar with 
            <br>the database that we are using for this project.
