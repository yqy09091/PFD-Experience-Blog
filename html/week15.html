        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week15 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">During week 15, I have tried to continue from the previous week's code, which is  
            <br>inserting the encoding image into the new database table. Now, I have a better understanding of the code
            <br>and managed to find out the I do not need to close the con or cursor which is different from what I learn. Another good practice
            <br>is that I need to commit after I insert something to the table. I never did that because when I was working with MSSQL, they had
            <br>different practices, which is only to commit when all the inserts are done. So, these different practices 
            <br>caused some errors and bugs here and there.
            <br>Other than that, I also made some careless mistakes. For example, when I inserted the data into the database,
            <br>the correct name was 'encoding', but I typed 'encode', all of them are causing trouble for me. And now, after
            <br>debugging, everything seems to be working, and I can continue with other tasks.
