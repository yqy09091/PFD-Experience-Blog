        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week13 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">During week 13 I have continue my FRATS, this time round i am trying 
            <br>to add pop up message when user is interacting with the FRATS website. To do this I need to
            <br>use flask, html and bootstrap, in order to display the pou up message. Which is more challenging 
            <br>as it is more complex compared to pure html/css/javaScript.
            <br>But after some research I am able to display the pop up message to
            <br>the user. For example, when they upload a image and if it is successful a successful uploaded 
            <br>message will display and the color is green color. For things like key in wrong user name and
            <br>password user will received a message of wrong password or user name and the color of the 
            <br>message will be brown to tell user something went wrong.
