        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Week1 - Blog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">For the first week we have brainstorm and discuss what to do for our project.
            <br>We agree with using Open CV to do this project. Our work are divided to 4 parts.
            <br>Open CV in python, a database to store the user image and other datas, a application
            <br>that collect image form user and other features and lastly combine them together.
            <br>
            <br>OpenCV can do facial recognition and tracking, which can help to collect data,
            <br>open cv support python and we all know python so opencv is a good idea. Next for
            <br>the data base we decide to use SQlite a database that work with opencv and can store
            <br>image. Listly we will use visual studio code to develop the website.
            <br>
            <br>For myself, I think will do the somewebsite and help to connect the website,database
            <br>and open cv together.
